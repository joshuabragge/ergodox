## v1.3

*2018-06-11*

### Base
* Removed double tap `TAB` for `ALT`+`TAB`. The double tap was not fast enough when being used multiple times in a row.
* Added a dedicated `ALT`+`TAB` button to replace `DEL` button. 
* Added movement layer back to `TAB`.
* Removed `ENTER` on the right hand pinky.
* Moved `\` to the right hand as to keep all the punctuation and symbols together.
* Reorganized punctuation so most used is easier to reach.
* Added tap for `-` double tap for `_`.

### Movement
* Moved `CTRL`+`SHIFT` key to the other side so it is possible to hold movement layer key while highlighting text with arrows.
* Reverted VIM mouse keys to WASD keys because layout was just too difficult to adjust to.
* Moved mouse wheel buttons to right hand to be consistent with VIM layout.
* Moved mouse click buttons so they are not blocking other usefuly keys on the base layer for navigation

* Increased mouse speed from 2 to 5.
* Removed arrow keys from symbol layer so that the layer can more closely mimic a number pad.

* Removed Movement layer activation from `TAB` key
* Added tap for `TAB` double tap for `ALT`+`TAB`.
* Added web page navigation keys.
